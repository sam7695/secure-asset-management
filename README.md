## Additional Considerations
- **Authorization:**
  - Restricts access to sensitive data only to authorized users.
  - Uses JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
  - Protects routes like `/auth/logout` to ensure only authenticated users can access them.

- **Data End-to-End Encryption:**
  - Ensures data privacy and security, even if intercepted during transmission or stored in the database.
  - Uses an encryption service to generate RSA key pairs, encrypt data with a public key, and decrypt data with a private key.
  - Generates a unique key pair for each user.

- **Test Assessment Setup:**
  - Uses a local server with a lightweight database for ease of testing and assessment.
  - Notes that a more robust database solution and server infrastructure would be required for real-world scenarios.

## Future Upgrades
- **Database replacement:**
  - Consider using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or others in a production environment.

- **Infrastructure and security enhancements:**
  - Deploy on cloud platforms, implement HTTPS, and incorporate additional security measures.
